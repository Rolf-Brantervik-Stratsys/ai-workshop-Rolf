35775;"68. When reporting on the legal form of the undertaking according to national legislation under paragraph 24(e)(i), the undertaking can choose from one of the following undertaking structures: (a) private limited liability undertaking (b) sole proprietorship (c) partnership (d) cooperative (e) other (please specify based on country specifications for legal forms). 69. When reporting on the NACE code(s) of the undertaking under paragraph 24(e)(ii), NACE codes (Nomenclature statistique des Activités économiques dans la Communauté Européenne) are classifications of economic activities used in the European Union. They provide a standardized framework for classifying economic activities into sectors, enabling comparability and a common understanding among the various EU countries. 70. The NACE code consists of a number of digits ranging from 2 to 5 depending on the level of specificity with which the economic activity is identified. The list of NACE codes can be found in the following document: REGULATION (EC) No 1893/2006. 71. When reporting the number of employees under paragraph 24(e)(v), full-time equivalent (FTE) is the number of full-time positions in an undertaking. It can be calculated by dividing an employee's scheduled hours (total effective hours worked in a week) by the employer's hours for a full-time workweek (total hours performed by full-time employees). For example, an employee who works 25 hours every week for a company where the full-time week is 40 hours represents a 0.625 FTE (i.e. 25/40 hours). 72. Headcount is the total number of people employed by the undertaking at a given time. 73. When reporting on the country of primary operations and the location of significant assets under paragraphs 24(e)(vi) and (vii), the undertaking shall disclose this information for each of its sites using the table below (see standard for tables - s.16): 74. The geolocation of an undertaking is expected to be a valuable datapoint for stakeholders for the assessment of risks and opportunities connected to the SME, particularly in relation to the sustainability issues of climate change adaptation, water, ecosystems and biodiversity. 75. The geolocation shall be provided in spatial points for single units or polygon points defining the boundaries of a larger, less unit-like site, such as a farm, mine or facility. The undertaking may also provide a cluster of points to allow for the easy identification of the concerned area. The spatial points shall be provided as coordinates, with five decimal places (e.g. 0° 00' 0.036""). 76. When disclosing the geolocation of sites owned, leased, or managed, the undertaking shall include the coordinates of the sites in the table shown in paragraph 73. The undertaking may use web mapping tools (e.g. Google Maps, Apple Maps) to identify the coordinates of sites that it owns, leases or manages. The undertaking may also use any appropriate software tools or platforms to further establish the perimeter or area of larger sites."
35776;8. In the presentation of information in ESRS 2 SBM-2 point 43, the company shall state how the interests, views, and rights regarding its consumers and/or end users, including respect for their human rights, have influenced the company's strategy and business model. Consumers and/or end users are an important stakeholder group.
35777;9. When reporting the information in ESRS 2 SBM-2 point 43, the company shall provide information on how the interests, views, and rights of the employees in its own value chain that could be significantly affected by the company have been considered, including respect for their human rights. Employees in the value chain are important affected stakeholders.
35778;Appropriate measures to manage risks associated with business relationships may sometimes include continuing the business relationship throughout the risk mitigation effort or temporarily suspending it while the risk mitigation work is ongoing. It may also involve terminating the business relationship, e.g., if the company fails to mitigate risks, if the company believes the risks cannot be mitigated, or due to the severity of the negative impact. The company should take into account potential social and economic negative impacts in the decision to terminate the business relationship. In these plans, the company should specify what actions it will take, as well as what it expects from its suppliers, buyers, and other business relationships. PRACTICAL MEASURES a. Designate who will be responsible for developing, implementing, and monitoring these plans. b. Assist or collaborate with relevant business relationships to devise appropriate plans to prevent or mitigate identified negative impacts within reasonable and clearly defined timeframes. The plans should include qualitative and quantitative indicators to define and measure improvements (which are sometimes referred to as improvement plans). ? See question 38 in the appendix. c. Use the company's influence as much as possible to persuade the business relationship to prevent or limit negative impacts or risks. ? See questions 36 and 40 in the appendix. d. If the company does not have sufficient influence, attempt to find ways to increase influence over the business relationship, including through outreach by senior management and through commercial incentives. Collaborate to the greatest possible extent with other stakeholders to build and exercise collective influence, for example through collaborative efforts in industry associations or through cooperation with governments. ? See question 37 in the appendix. e. To prevent potential (future) negative impacts and manage actual impacts, try to build influence in new and existing business relationships, e.g., through policies or codes of conduct, agreements, written arrangements, or the use of market influence. ? See section II, 1.3 and question 36 in the appendix. f. Regarding impacts on human rights, encourage entities that cause or contribute to negative impacts to consult and collaborate with affected or potentially affected rights holders or their representatives in the work of developing and implementing improvement plans. ? See questions 8–11 in the appendix. g. Assist relevant suppliers and other business relationships to prevent or reduce negative impacts or risks, e.g., by providing training, upgrading facilities, or strengthening their management systems, to achieve ongoing improvements. ? See question 38 in the appendix. h. Consider, as a last resort, terminating the cooperation with the supplier or business relationship if a negative impact cannot be prevented or mitigated, if the negative impact is irreparable, if there are no reasonable prospects for change, or if serious negative impacts or risks are identified and the entity causing the impact does not immediately take action to prevent or limit it. The company should, in all plans to terminate the cooperation, also consider how important the supplier or business relationship is to the company, what the legal consequences will be of maintaining or ending the relationship, and how a termination might change the impact in practice. The company should also consider reliable information about what negative social and economic effects the decision to terminate cooperation might have. ? See question 39 in the appendix. i. If a company decides to maintain a business relationship, it should be able to explain what measures it is taking to mitigate risks. It should also be aware of the reputational, financial, or legal risks involved in continuing the collaboration. j. Urge relevant authorities in the country where the impact occurs to act, e.g., through inspections, enforcement, and application of applicable laws and other regulations. ? See box 6.
35779;Assess in particular whether the company has caused (or could cause) the negative impact, or contributed (or could contribute) to the negative impact, or whether the negative impact is (or could be) directly linked to its operations, products or services through a business relationship. PRACTICAL MEASURES a. Consult with business relationships, other affected companies, and other relevant stakeholders. b. Consult with affected stakeholders and rights holders or their legitimate representatives. c. Consult relevant internal or external experts as needed. d. If affected stakeholders or rights holders do not share the company's assessment of its involvement in the actual or potential negative impact, cooperate in good faith within the legitimate mechanisms available to find a solution where there are discrepancies and to remedy the impact. ? See questions 51–52 in the annex.
35780;Average data method for leased buildings (if floor space data is available) CO2e emissions from franchises = sum across building types: ? (total floor space of building type (m2) × average emission factor for building type (kg CO2e/m2/year))
35781;Average-data method (distribution) CO2e emissions from distribution = sum across storage facilities: ? (volume of stored goods (m3 or pallet or TEU) × average number of days stored (days) × emission factor for storage facility (kg CO2e/m3 or pallet or TEU/day))
35782;Average-data method for leased buildings (where floor space data is available) CO2e emissions from leased assets = sum across building types: ? (total floor space of building type (m2) × average emission factor for building type (kg CO2e/m2/year))
35788;Court decisions or decisions from authorities in third countries where it is required that a data controller or a data processor transfers or discloses personal data may be recognized or carried out in any way only if they are based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, that applies between the requesting third country and the union or a member state, without prejudice to other grounds for transfer under this chapter.
35789;Develop and implement plans that are appropriate to prevent and limit potential (future) negative impacts. PRACTICAL MEASURES a. Assign the applicable senior decision-maker the responsibility to ensure that operations causing or contributing to negative impacts cease, and to prevent operations that may cause or contribute to negative impacts in the future. b. In cases of complex impacts or operations that may be difficult to stop due to operational, contractual, or legal issues, establish a roadmap for how the company should proceed to cease operations causing or contributing to negative impacts. This may involve involving internal legal counsel and collaborating with affected or potentially affected stakeholders and rights holders. c. Update the company's policies to provide guidance on how the company should avoid and manage negative impacts in the future and ensure their implementation. d. Provide appropriate training for the company's relevant employees and management. e. Based on the results of the risk assessment, update and strengthen the management systems to better track information and attend to risks before negative impacts occur. ? See section 1.2. f. Consult and collaborate with stakeholders who are affected or potentially affected and rights holders and their representatives to develop appropriate measures and implement the plan. ? See questions 8–11 in the appendix. g. In cases of collective or cumulative impacts (i.e., where the company is just one of several entities contributing to the negative impact), try to cooperate with other involved entities whenever possible to halt the impact and prevent it from occurring again or to prevent risks from arising, for example through industry initiatives and collaboration with governments. ? See box 6 in the appendix. h. If the company contributes to negative impacts or risks caused by another entity, it should take the necessary steps to cease contributing or to prevent it from contributing as outlined above. It should also increase and leverage its influence to the greatest extent possible to limit any ongoing impact. ? See section 3.2 c–e and question 34 in the appendix.
35790;Direct use-phase emissions from products that directly consume energy (fuels or electricity) during use: sum across fuels consumed from use of products: ? (total lifetime expected uses of product × number sold in reporting period × fuel consumed per use (kWh) × emission factor for fuel (kg CO2 e/kWh)) or/and sum across electricity consumed from use of products (Used in this example): ? (total lifetime expected uses of product × number sold in reporting period × electricity consumed per use (kWh) × emission factor for electricity (kg CO2 e/kWh)) or/and sum across refrigerant leakage from use of products: ? (total lifetime expected uses of product × number sold in reporting period × refrigerant leakage per use (kg) × global warming potential (kg CO2 e/kg))
35797;Member States may specify the particular conditions under which a national identification number or any other commonly accepted method of identification may be processed. A national identification number or another commonly accepted method of identification shall, in such cases, only be used with due regard to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects under this regulation.
35799;PRACTICAL MEASURES a. Allow top management to be responsible for and oversee due diligence and give the board responsibility for responsible entrepreneurship more generally. ? See question 16 in the appendix. b. Allow the concerned departments to be responsible for implementing various aspects of these policies, with a particular focus on the employees whose actions and decisions are expected to largely increase or decrease risks. ? See question 16 in the appendix. c. Develop or adapt existing information and accounting systems to collect information on due diligence processes, as well as related decision-making and actions. d. Establish or use existing communication channels between relevant persons in top management and implementing departments to exchange information about and document risks and decision-making. e. Encourage work teams and business units to create a common vision around relevant aspects of the company's policies on responsible entrepreneurship. This can, for instance, be done by forming cross-functional groups or committees that can exchange information and jointly make decisions about risks, including business units that may influence compliance with the policies on responsible entrepreneurship in decision-making. ? See question 16 in the appendix. f. Offer employees training to help them understand and implement relevant aspects of policies on responsible entrepreneurship and provide resources that are proportional to the due diligence required. g. Develop incentives for employees and business units that are consistent with the company's policies on responsible entrepreneurship. h. Develop or base on or adapt existing complaint procedures so that employees can raise issues or make complaints regarding matters related to responsible entrepreneurship (e.g., working methods, corruption, corporate governance). i. Develop processes to manage, or take action to remedy, situations where the policy on responsible entrepreneurship is not followed (e.g., through additional investigations, capacity building, or disciplinary actions/sanctions).
35800;PRACTICAL MEASURES a. Attempt to assist those affected in returning to the situation they would have been in if the negative impact had not occurred (if possible) and enable redress that is proportional to the severity and extent of the negative impact. b. Follow the law and try to find international guidelines for redress if such exist. If such standards or guidelines do not exist, consider taking redressive measures that correspond to those taken in similar cases. i. The type of redress or combination of redressive measures that is appropriate depends on the type and extent of the negative impact. This can include apologies, restoration or reparation (e.g., reinstating dismissed employees, recognizing unions in collective bargaining), financial or other compensation (e.g., establishing compensation funds for victims or future outreach and training programs), punishment (e.g., dismissing personnel guilty of misconduct), and measures to prevent future negative impacts. ? See question 50 in the attachment. c. Regarding impact on human rights, consult and collaborate with affected rights holders and their representatives when determining redress. ? See questions 8–11 and 50. d. Try to evaluate whether those who have raised complaints are satisfied with the process and its outcome.
35801;PRACTICAL MEASURES a. Map the company’s operations, suppliers, and other business relationships, including relevant supply chains that pertain to the prioritized risk. b. Establish a list of specific standards and issues regarding responsible business conduct that apply to the risk under assessment, including applicable provisions in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, as well as domestic laws and relevant international and industry-specific frameworks concerning responsible business conduct. c. Gather, when appropriate and possible, relevant information about business relationships with which the company does not have contracts (e.g., subcontractors outside the 'first tier'). Establish processes, either individually or jointly, to assess risks associated with more distant links in the business relationship, including by reviewing existing assessments and collaborating with actors in the intermediary levels of the supply chain and control points to evaluate their due diligence practices in light of this guidance. d. Assess the type and extent of actual and potential impact on prioritized operations, suppliers, or other business relationships (i.e., what issues related to responsible business conduct are affected and how, the extent of the impact, etc.). Use, where applicable, information from the company’s own or third-party environmental impact assessments, descriptions of environmental and social consequences, descriptions of impacts on human rights, legal reviews, corruption control systems, financial audits (intended for disclosure), workplace inspections, and other relevant assessments of business relationships conducted by the company, the industry, or multi-stakeholder initiatives, including assessments related to environmental, social aspects, labor conditions, corruption assessments, and procedures for know your counterpart. e. Identify operations that are not sufficiently carried out within an appropriate legal and institutional framework to protect the rights of individuals and businesses involved. f. Assess the risks concerning responsible business conduct before a proposed business action (e.g., a company acquisition, a restructuring, or a newly developed product or service) to predict how the proposed operation and associated business relationships may negatively affect specific issues related to responsible business conduct. g. Periodically reassess this impact as needed: prior to significant decisions or changes in operations (e.g., market entry, product launch, policy change, or significant changes in operations), after or before changes in the operating environment (e.g., increased social tensions), and periodically throughout the duration of the operation or business relationship. h. Regarding impacts related to human rights, consult and cooperate with affected and potentially affected rights holders, including workers, worker representatives, and trade unions, to gather information on negative impacts and risks, and consider potential obstacles that prevent stakeholders from effectively participating in such consultations. If it is not possible to consult rights holders directly, consider reasonable alternatives, such as leveraging reliable, independent expert resources, including human rights defenders, trade unions, and civil society groups. Consult with potentially affected rights holders both before and during projects or operations that may impact them (e.g., through on-site assessments). ? See questions 8–11 and 25. i. Pay special attention in assessing impacts related to human rights to the potential negative impact on individuals from groups or populations that may face an elevated risk of vulnerability or marginalization, and different risks that may affect women and men. j. For companies with multiple units within a corporate group, support local units in making their own assessments.
35802;PRACTICAL MEASURES a. Report publicly on the company's due diligence processes, with due consideration for business confidentiality and other competition or security concerns, e.g., in the company's annual reports, sustainability reports, reports on responsible business conduct, or other forms of disclosure. Include policies on responsible business conduct, information on measures taken to incorporate responsible business conduct into policies and management systems, and the company's major identified risk areas, as well as information on identified, prioritized, and negative impacts that have been assessed as serious, or risks, prioritization criteria, measures taken to prevent or mitigate these risks, including estimated timelines and benchmarks for improvements and results, measures to follow up on implementation and results, and the company's provision or cooperation for remedy. b. Disclose the above information in a manner that is accessible and appropriate, e.g., on the company's website, in the company's premises, and in local languages. c. Regarding the impact on human rights that the company causes or contributes to, be prepared to inform rights holders affected or potentially affected, as soon as possible, in a culturally sensitive and accessible manner, about the points mentioned above that are particularly relevant to them, especially when they or someone on their behalf raises relevant issues. ? See Section II, 2.4 and Section II, 2.12
35803;Processing of personal data concerning convictions in criminal cases and offenses or related security measures according to Article 6.1 may only be carried out under the control of an authority or when processing is permitted according to union law or the national law of the member states, where appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects are established. A complete register of convictions in criminal cases may only be maintained under the control of an authority.
35805;The checklist contains questions about how the premises and workspaces in the office are designed. It begins with some general subject areas and ends with some commonly occurring workspaces. The checklist is suitable for use by the responsible manager and safety representative during a comprehensive safety inspection. For more targeted inspections, we refer to our in-depth subject checklists. Based on the following laws and regulations: AFS 2012:2 Load ergonomics AFS 2011:19 Chemical workplace risks AFS 2009:2 Design of the workplace AFS 2005:16 Noise AFS 2001:3 Use of personal protective equipment AFS 2001:1 Systematic work environment management (SAM) AFS 1999:7 First aid and crisis support AFS 1998:5 Work at the screen AFS 1993:2 Violence and threats in the work environment BFS 2011:16 Functional control of ventilation systems and certification of qualified functional controllers SFS 1982:673 Working hours act
35807;The data controller shall notify each recipient to whom the personal data has been disclosed of any rectifications or erasure of personal data or restrictions on processing that have occurred in accordance with Articles 16, 17.1, and 18, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. The data controller shall inform the data subject of these recipients at the request of the data subject.
35808;The data processor and individuals who perform work under the supervision of the data controller or the data processor, and who have access to personal data, may only process this data on the instructions of the data controller, unless they are required to do so under Union law or the national law of member states.
35809;The data subject shall have the right to request the controller to rectify inaccurate personal data concerning them without undue delay. Taking into account the purpose of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to complete incomplete personal data, including by providing a supplementary statement.
35811;The mapping may include information on sector-specific, geographical, product-related, and company-specific risk factors, including known risks to which the company has been exposed or is expected to be exposed. The company should, with the help of this mapping, be able to establish a preliminary priority order for the biggest risk areas that the company should investigate further. Companies with less heterogeneous operations, particularly smaller businesses, do not always need to carry out such mapping before proceeding to identify and prioritize specific impacts. PRACTICAL MEASURES a. Establish an initial overview of the company's areas of operation and different types of business relationships to understand what information needs to be collected. b. Gather information to understand what the biggest risks of negative impact are concerning sector-specific risk factors (e.g., products and their supply chains, services and other operations), geographical risk factors (e.g., corporate governance and the rule of law, conflicts, pervasive negative impacts on human rights or the environment) or company-specific risk factors (e.g., known cases of corruption, misconduct, implementation of standards for responsible business conduct). ? See question 20 in the appendix. Information can, among other things, be obtained from reports from governments, international organizations, civil society organizations, employee representatives and unions, national human rights institutions, media, or other experts. ? See questions 21–22 in the appendix. c. Consult with relevant stakeholders and experts about any gaps in the information. d. Consider information obtained through early warning systems (e.g., helplines) and complaint mechanisms. e. Identify the biggest areas of risk concerning responsible business conduct and prioritize these as a starting point for a deeper assessment of potential and actual impact. f. Review the results of the mapping regularly. g. Update the mapping with new information in case of significant changes within the company. For example, this could occur when the company starts operations in or purchases from a new country, develops a new product or service offering significantly different from the existing offering, changes the composition of a product or service, or reorganizes or initiates new forms of business relationships (e.g., corporate concentrations, mergers and acquisitions, new clients, and markets).
35812;The transfer of personal data that is being processed or is intended to be processed after it has been transferred to a third country or an international organization may only occur on the condition that the data controller and the data processor, subject to the other provisions of this regulation, meet the requirements of this chapter, including for further transfer of personal data from the third country or the international organization to another third country or another international organization. All provisions of this chapter shall apply to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons ensured by this regulation is not undermined.
35814;Then use the lessons learned from the follow-up to improve these processes in the future. PRACTICAL MEASURES a. Monitor and follow up on the implementation and results of the company's own internal commitments, efforts, and goals regarding due diligence. The company can, for example, regularly conduct internal or external audits or reviews of the outcomes and communicate the results at various levels within the company. b. Regularly evaluate business relationships to ensure that risk mitigation measures are implemented or to ensure that negative impacts have indeed been prevented or mitigated. c. Regarding the impact on human rights that the company has caused or contributed to or may cause or contribute to, attempt to consult and collaborate with affected or potentially affected rights holders, including employees, employee representatives, and trade unions. ? See questions 8–11 in the appendix. d. Promote the implementation of regular reviews of relevant multi-stakeholder and industry initiatives in which the company participates, including their compliance with this guidance and their value to the company in helping to identify, prevent, or mitigate negative impacts related to its operations, considering the initiatives' independence. ? See question 12 in the appendix. e. Identify negative impacts or risks that may have been overlooked in previous due diligence processes and include these in the future. f. Use the lessons learned during the company's due diligence work to improve the process and outcomes in the future. ? See question 44 in the appendix.
35818;Upstream emissions of purchased fuels Upstream CO2 e emissions of purchased fuels (extraction, production, and transportation of fuels consumed by the reporting company) = sum across each fuel type consumed: ?
